# ComplexAccessibility
showcase of complex interface where talckback faces difficlties


Problems:
1) First item that gets focused is not the topmost item of the screen
2) The only way to select main buttons is to manualy change focuse to the header block
3) overall focus order is strange, although I understend that the screen is complex, thats why we want focus-order api =)
